## Typescript Calculator

Hello! I coded along with a typescript video to create a little calculator. I recently finished up a typescript course with FrontEnd master's and wanted to create something tangible using typescript

## What I learned

I now better understand what typescript is and how to use types. I also understand what it means to compile typescript into a javascript file. With basic Javascript, I also better understand switch statements now.

## Setting up notes

npm install -g typescript
close and restart terminal
tsc -v checks version
npm init -y --creates package.json
create index.ts file
tsc /index.ts -create a js file of your ts file
npm install --save readline-sync
npm install --save @types/readline-sync

first tsc index.ts then node ./index.js compiles info into a js file
